# Red-vs-Blue-Team-Project    Kehinde Tosho-Obembe/Red Team Project
This report has been prepared for the purpose of identifying critical vulnerabilities on my clients network. The monitoring setup instructions for Capstone and ELK web server didn't setup Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Packetbeat.



 Day 1 Activity File: Red Team# Day 1 Activity File: Red Team
 
### Monitoring Setup Instructions
 
- As the you attack a web server today, it will send all of the attack info to an ELK server.
 
- The following setup commands need to be run on the **Capstone** machine before the attack takes place in order to make sure the server is collecting logs.
 
- Be sure to complete these steps before starting the attack instructions.
 
**Instructions**
 
- Double click on the 'HyperV Manager' Icon on the Desktop to open the HyperV Manager.
 
- Choose the `Capstone` machine from the list of Virtual Machines and double-click it to get a terminal window.
 
- Login to the machine using the credentials: `vagrant:tnargav`
 
- Switch to the root user with `sudo su`
 
#### Setup Filebeat
 
Run the following commands:
- `filebeat modules enable apache`
- `filebeat setup`
 
The output should look like this:
 
![](../../../Images/ELk-Setup/filebeat.png)
 
#### Setup Metricbeat
 
Run the following commands:
- `metricbeat modules enable apache`
- `metricbeat setup`
 
The output should look like this:
 
![](../../../Images/ELk-Setup/Metricbeat.png)
 
#### Setup Packetbeat
 
Run the following command:
- `packetbeat setup`
 
The output should look like this:
 
![](../../../Images/ELk-Setup/Packetbeat.png)
 
Restart all 3 services. Run the following commands:
- `systemctl restart filebeat`
- `systemctl restart metricbeat`
- `systemctl restart packetbeat`
 
These restart commands should not give any output:
 
![](../../../Images/ELk-Setup/enable.png)
 
Once all three of these have been enabled, close the terminal window for this machine and proceed with your attack.

### Attack!
 
Today, you will act as an offensive security Red Team to exploit a vulnerable Capstone VM.
 
You will need to use the following tools, in no particular order:
- Firefox
- Hydra
- Nmap
- John the Ripper
- Metasploit
- curl
- MSVenom
 
### Setup
 
Your entire attack will take place using the `Kali Linux` Machine.
 
- Inside the HyperV Manager, double-click on the `Kali` machine to bring up the VM login window.
 
- Login with the credentials: `root:toor`
 
### Instructions
 
Complete the following to find the flag:
 
- Discover the IP address of the Linux web server.
 - 192.168.1.105
 
- Locate the hidden directory on the web server.
    - **Hint**: Use a browser to see which web pages will load, and/or use a tool like `dirb` to find URLs on the target site
 
 
.
http://192.168.1.105/company_folders/secret_folder
 
- Brute force the password for the hidden directory using the hydra command:
    - **Hint**: You may need to use `gunzip` to unzip `rockyou.txt.gz` before running Hydra.
    - **Hint**: `hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> -s <port> -f -vV <victim.server.ip.address> http-get <path/to/secret/directory>`
 
hydra -l ashton -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 80 -f -vV 192.168.1.105 http-get http://192.168.1.105/company_folders/secret_folder  
 


 
 
- Break the hashed password with the Crack Station website or John the Ripper.
 

 
 
- Connect to the server via WebDav.
    - **Hint**: Look for WebDAV connection instructions in the file located in the secret directory. Note that these instructions may have an old IP Address in them, so you will need to use the IP address you have discovered.
 



 
- Upload a PHP reverse shell payload.
    - **Hint**: Try using your scripting skills! MSVenom may also be helpful.
 

 
 
- Execute payload that you uploaded to the site to open up a meterpreter session.
- Find and capture the flag.

 
 
 









I concluded this report with an immersive and very hand-on assessment where I was able to use the tactics and tools available as a Red team player giving a better understanding of how data exploitation happens and being aware of the vulnerabilities a malicious hacker posts to my 
clients. 
As a company, it is important to think, not if a security breach will occur, but when and how.
Reconnaissance of vulnerable machine using nmap
Confirmed that a port scan occurred 
Found the occurrence of simplistic usernames and weak passwords
Brute Force passwords to gain system access
Cracked a hashed password to gain system access and use a shell script
Found requests for a hidden directories
Identified a WebDAV vulnerability
 
Finally I captured the flag.
 


 
 
After you have captured the flag, show it to your instructor.
 
Be sure to save important files (e.g., scan results) and take screenshots as you work through the assessment. You'll use them again when creating your presentation.
